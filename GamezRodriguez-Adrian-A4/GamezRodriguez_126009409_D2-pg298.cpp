Bonus questions:
1. g++ file1.cpp space file2.cpp, it takes to source code files and makes a single execution code 
2. extern int works by declaring a global variable that can be accessed by any other file
3. namespace works by declaring a region that provide the scope of identifiers
4. pass-by-value to pass small objects and makes a copy of the object 
	pass-by-const-reference to pass large objects that you donâ€™t need to modify. 
		pass-by-reference actually changes the actual argument of the paramater.
