Notes on code:
Excersice 3 and 4: To test you have to change the char[] in the code to whatever you want, the outout should be correct, 
On exercise 14 I used an exception for the advance function in the case that the input is negative meaning wanting to go backwards.
and had to create a struct of List to hold the entire list, and used it to implement find, erase, and insert as we did not have a prev.
